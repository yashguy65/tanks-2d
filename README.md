# tanks-2d
main.py is the primary file
Has code for most functions, but is missing quite a bit (including stability)
I was unfortunately out for 6 of 12 days so this was heavily rushed 


REQUIREMENTS (if not using poetry you can try [pip install package==version] for missing libraries)
pygame = "2.5.2"
beautifulsoup4 = "4.12.2"
soupsieve = "2.5"
mysql-connector = "2.2.9"
